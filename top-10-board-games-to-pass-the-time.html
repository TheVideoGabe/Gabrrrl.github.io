                        <h2 class="section-heading">#10 Villainous</h2>
                        <iframe class="container" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I1JoAR9icU0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                        <p>Villanous is the first boardgame I've played where you can play together separetly. Everyone has an objective, but we are not using the same board.
                       <p>This game can be fun when everyone knows how to play, but starting the game off with a lot of new people will make the game very slow.</p>
                       <p>Other tahn that, the game mechanics are pretty cool, and the fact that's it's Disney villain themed makes it even more fun.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">#9 Uno Flip (2019)</h2>
                        <iframe class="container" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l-AyukgblK4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            <p>Uno flip is a great party game, and a very unforgiving one too. This version of uno will make you never go back to the original ever again.</p>
                            <p>The game is more fast-paced than the original and the "dark" side of the cards make for a more fun game with friends.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">#8 Catan</h2>
                        <iframe class="container" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oiQ6SgBzfqY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            <p>Catan is a great and easy party game. My first time playing was really bad because i didn't know what the desert tiles stood for and i chose to place all my starting pieces next to them. Great times.</p>
                            <p>After seeing how much strategy and luck was involved when I played the game, I had to add it to this list.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">#7 Hive</h2>
                        <iframe class="container" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3dGd9dpOerc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            <p>Hive! really weird concept of a game. But the startegy behind it hooks you.</p>
                            <p>Just like chess, this can be a really short game or some hours will go by strategizing. Either way this game is very fun and you can take it anywhere on the go.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">#6 Chess</h2>
                        <iframe class="container" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GL-uWmw4YMA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            <p>Chess. Great game, even better history behind it.</p>
                            <p>Chess has always had a place in my heart after some teacher came to my school in Mexico and gave us a quick lesson on how to play.</p>
                            <p>I'm glad chess streamers and the Netflix show "Queens Gambit" brought this game/sport back into the mainstream.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">#5 Munchkin</h2>
                        <iframe class="container" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uhpPxXCNtRg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            <p>Munchkin can be a really fun game, or a really table flipping one depending on your friend group.</p>
                            <p>Overall It's still a great party game that promotes helping one another, bartering, and backstabbing. I reccomend it.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">#4 Exploding kittens</h2>
                        <iframe class="container" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kAkRKuv5Rts" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            <p>Exploding Kittens! The hot potato of the tabletop genre. This game is really fun and suspensful at times.</p>
                            <p>The best part about it is that it will always end. A winner will be left standing after everyones has met their fate to a exploding cat.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">#3 7 wonders duel</h2>
                        <iframe class="container" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kkPifTz7rt0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                            <p>7 Wonders Duel is a great stategy game. You're able to win many different ways.
                            <p>You're always trying to foil your opponets plans but you can't let your own fall apart.</p>
                            <p>So the gameplay is always a tug-n-pull in many aspects of the game, and that makes every round feel fresh and different.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">#2 Here to Slay</h2>
                        <iframe class="container" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gsPZoEJyYMM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                                <p>Here to Slay is one of the newest and greatest games I've picked up recently.</p>
                                <p>Even playing a two player games feels great, and the turns in game can go really fast because you have a limited amount of Action points to use.</p>
                                <p>You can win the game 2 different ways and your opponent is always trying to make you stumble.</p>
                                <p>I really reccomend this game!</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">#1 The binding of issac: four souls</h2>
                        <iframe class="container" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ya2iujUGP-E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                                <p>Four souls is a pretty good dungeon crawler rogue-like game. It even has a shop with coins!</p>
                                <p>It has many cards and items that can synergize together to make great plays and or backstack other players.</p>
                                <p>This game feels fresh everytime it restarts, the game mechanics are straightforward when it comes to taking your turn, bartering is encouraged when you want anything to happen in the game.</p>
                                <p>Overall this game is really good and can be played with a lot of people, but expect to have someone either be completely OP or a weakling that keeps dying every turn.</p>
                                <p>Many frienships will be destroyed 10/10.</p>
