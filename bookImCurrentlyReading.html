                       <h1>Here for It: Or, How to Save Your Soul in America</h1>
                       <p>I was intrigued by the chapters in "Here for It: Or, How to Save Your Soul in America" and the personal experience that came with them. Learning about other people's self discovery can be thought provoking.</p>
                       <p>The main idea is what if feels to be a person of color, and the history you have to bring with you growing up. An example of this is seen when the Thomas talks about his family saying "my mother had been involved with the black panthers and my father had taken over the student center at MIT at a civil rights protest during undergrad". Some ideas that Thomas explored in the "Historically Black" chapter was that no matter how black you think you are, or the way you see yourself, the world has already labelled you as a person of color, maybe even your parents or grandparents had to fight for equal opportunities in the past. And that comes with the expectations for you or your fellow peers to educate others on your culture and values to keep equality blossoming for future generations and not let differences in upbringing create gaps in opportunity. The idea that there are many types of blackness in the community is talked about, but the internal struggle people of color face together is not a personal struggle but rather a collected issue in which blackness (ethnicity) could be used as a weapon against them. College was a corner stone for the Thomas to discover this, something he didn't want to come to terms with, although his fellow classmates in the black student union shifted his perspective.</p>
                       <p>The main idea Is how it can be reality shattering to explore your sexuality when religion has already done that for you and compares the experience to the passage "Disorientation is loss of the East. Ask any navigator: the east is what you sail by. Lose the east and you lose your bearings, your certainties, your knowledge of what is and what may be, perhaps even your life. Where was that star you followed to the manger? Thatâ€™s right. The east orients". Thomas explains how he never had the courage to explore and surround himself with people his interests were pulling him to. The queer student alliance was a stepping stone in exploring his sexuality during college. Finding someone that shared his desire was his priority at the time to see if being gay in a world where they are damned was possible. After Thomas found that someone, his perspective on life shifted. He was no longer in-line with his religion or norms, these rules that were instilled in him growing up were directly challenged. And that made him feel like he had to chose between accepting his beliefs therefore challenging his religion, or staying in the closet denying his feelings making him feel safe for the time being.</p>
                       <p>The evidence Thomas uses during "Historically Black" and "Disorientation" is personal experience and personal opinions he developed when he was at Columbia university. One specific rhetorical writing tool Thomas used was the Anacoluthon rhetorical device which was used when he was talking about the first openly gay person he met during his mandatory freshman orientation meeting. Thomas used this to emphasize the instructor being interrupted by someone asking "Actually, are you gay?" which is the most uncomfortable and rude thing someone can ask a gay person. Throughout his book Thomas writing style is semi-formal and because his target audience is college students we can really understand his voice and purpose in trying to inform us on what it feels like to be a gay black man growing up in America.</p>
                       <p>The way Thomas expressed his frustration with the insensitive sign his school library displayed which read: "From bondage to books: Black History Month" made me feel for Thomas. He expanded on the things that actually made black history month important in a sarcastic way but it backfired mostly because everyone who read it assumed Thomas was white, also his writing inexperience while trying to make a joke when he was actually angry played a role. I was also happy that this situation sparked a desire in Thomas to fix his wrongs and bring attention to what caused his anger in the first place, the sign.</p>
